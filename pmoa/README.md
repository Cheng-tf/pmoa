# PMOA-TTS: Textual Time Series from PubMed Case Reports

**PMOA-TTS** is a dataset of structured textual time series derived from 124k clinical case reports published in PubMed Open Access. Each data point corresponds to a single patient case and includes a sequence of timestamped clinical events extracted using large language models. This dataset is intended to support research in temporal modeling, survival analysis, event forecasting, and multimodal representation learning.

This release contains the full dataset preprocessed from raw annotated files generated by LLaMA 3.3. A future version will include annotations from DeepSeek-R1 for the full dataset to enable comparative modeling. The current DeepSeek-R1 annotations are for the 25k subset presented in the survival experiments of our paper.

---

## 💾 Dataset Summary

Each data point corresponds to a case report and includes:

- A **textual time series** of clinical events with timestamps.
- **Demographic information**: age, sex, and ethnicity (when available).
- A set of **diagnoses** extracted from the same report.
- A **death phenotype label** indicating whether the patient died or was censored, and the observed time.

---

## 📂 Dataset Splits

- **`train` [default]**: The full dataset of 124k single-patient case reports automatically extracted using LLaMA 3.3. This is the default split and contains the primary annotations used in downstream tasks.
- **`case_study_100`**: A curated benchmark of 100 case reports (88 present in this dataset), used in the paper to evaluate LLM-based vs. metadata-based case report identification. Each sample has been manually reviewed for single-case validity across five different diagnoses.
- **`case_study_25k_L33`**: A 25k-case subset of LLaMA 3.3-annotated reports used for downstream survival analysis experiments in the paper. This split is designed to support modeling and evaluation of time-to-event outcomes on a more computationally manageable subset.
- **`case_study_25k_DSR1`**: A 25k-case subset of DeepSeek-R1-annotated reports used for downstream survival analysis experiments in the paper. The `textual_timeseries` and `death_info` fields in this split are reconstructed from DeepSeek-R1 outputs, enabling comparative analysis between models across the same patient cohort.

## 📁 Data Fields

Each row in the dataset is a JSON object with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `pmc_id` | `str` | Folder-level ID for the PubMed case report (`PMC000xxxxxx` to `PMC011xxxxxx`) |
| `case_report_id` | `str` | Full filename for the case (e.g., `PMC6417290`) |
| `textual_timeseries` | `List[Dict]` | Time series of `{ "event": str, "time": int }` |
| `demographics` | `Dict` | `{"age": str or "Not Specified", "sex": str or "Not Specified", "ethnicity": str or "Not Specified"}` |
| `diagnoses` | `List[str]` | List of diagnosis terms extracted per case |
| `death_info` | `Dict` |`{"observed_time": int, "death_event_indicator": 0 or 1}` |

## 🔍 Intended Use

This dataset is intended for research in:

- Time series modeling from unstructured text
- Temporal representation learning
- Survival analysis (e.g., using `death_info`)
- Clinical forecasting (next-event prediction)
- Multimodal clinical modeling (text, time, demographics, outcomes)

## 📝 License

The dataset is derived from publicly available PubMed Open Access case reports. All annotations and metadata are released under the **CC BY NC SA 4.0** license.

## 🧩 Coming Soon
- DeepSeek-R1 annotations for full 125k dataset. (DeepSeek-R1 annotations for the 25k subset is already available).
